# Soft4PES
Software library for power electronic systems

The aim is to develop optimal control methods for power electronic systems, such as variable speed drives and converters connected to the grid.
The library consists of building blocks that allow for modular solutions, allowing for adaptation of the methods to different systems.
This work is under continuous development, so stay tuned!

The API documentation of the library can be found from: https://tau-power-electronic-systems.github.io/Soft4PES/
